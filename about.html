            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>I am a recent B.E. graduate in Information Science and Engineering from J.N.N College of Engineering, Shivamogga (Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi â€“ June 2024). My expertise lies in data analytics, database management, and machine learning, complemented by strong skills in Java programming and full-stack development.</p>
            <p>Through internships, academic projects, and simulations, I have gained practical experience in data preprocessing, SQL, Pandas, PySpark, and predictive modeling, while also working on Java, Android development, and file structures. My internship at Ekathva Innovations Pvt. Ltd. allowed me to work on big data analysis and machine learning projects, strengthening my ability to derive insights from complex datasets.</p>
            <p>In addition to my data and development experience, I have completed several cybersecurity job simulations, which enhanced my skills in threat analysis, network security, and ethical hacking. My certifications in Java, ethical hacking, and blockchain (NPTEL) further strengthen my technical background. I also completed an internship at Ekathva Innovations Pvt. Ltd., where I focused on big data analysis and machine learning projects, gaining valuable exposure to data-driven decision-making and scalable systems.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I attended a specialized cybersecurity course by Palo Alto in collaboration with ICT Academy, which provided me with in-depth knowledge of cutting-edge security technologies and industry best practices. I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences in a dynamic environment where I can contribute to impactful cybersecurity initiatives and full-stack development projects.</p>
